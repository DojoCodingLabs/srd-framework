# Consistency rules:
# - Sum of all persona user_pct values must be approximately 100%
# - Sum of all persona revenue_pct values must be approximately 100%
# - Sum of (ltv * user_count) for all personas must approximate target_revenue * 12
# - Every journey referenced in primary_journeys must exist in journeys.md
